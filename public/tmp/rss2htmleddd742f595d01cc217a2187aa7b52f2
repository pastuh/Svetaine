This could happen if a player exited a multiplayer game to main menu, and then joined another multiplayer game.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy Hunting,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;theHunter: Call of the Wild Team&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Species List - Medved-Taiga National Park</title>
      <description>Hi all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can imagine you are all keen to see what kind of wildlife you can expect to find in the upcoming Medved-Taiga reserve, so as such we put together a nice breakdown below.  Read on to see which animals you can expect to see on your hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, we also have an extra critter you might see running about, the weasel!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reindeer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/059590a8366de25d76812ac31b518a97c2d9e013.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reindeer, also known as caribou in North America, is a species of deer native to arctic, subarctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous regions of northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. Reindeer vary considerably in colour and size and both male or female can grow antlers, with the male's tending to be considerably larger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moose&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/afbb9ee0c8a9f8112f1b952c18d427a79e51d702.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moose is the largest extant species in the deer family. Moose are distinguished by the broad, flat (or palmate) antlers of the males. Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Musk Deer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/058ddea19387d420b1cc11863e65b67c85ad403d.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Musk deer resemble small deer with a stocky build, and hind legs longer than their front legs. They are about 80 to 100 cm (31 to 39 in) long, 50 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in) high at the shoulder, and weigh between 7 and 17 kg (15 and 37 lb). These deer have no antlers, but the males do have enlarged upper canines, forming sabre-like tusks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brown Bear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/649548c856689d253d8aaf2fd5988051218a37b8.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brown bear is a large bear with the widest distribution of any living ursid. The species is distributed across much of northern Eurasia and North America. It is one of the two largest terrestrial carnivorans alive today, rivaled in body size only by its close cousin, the polar bear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wild Boar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/7133728aaeb854a7a60d4e3fb60984accfb0e6e0.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wild boar, also known as the wild swine or Eurasian wild pig, is native to much of Eurasia, North Africa, and the Greater Sunda Islands. Human intervention has spread its distribution further, making the species one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world. Its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability mean that it has continued to flourish in the wild&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lynx&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/b0e98b943f8d00eb41d829e1a528c6dbcb6a05d9.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lynx have a short tail, characteristic tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears, large, padded paws for walking on snow and long whiskers on the face. Under their neck, they have a ruff which has black bars resembling a bow tie although this is often not visible.  Being extremely intelligent and in possession of excellent senses, these are sure to be a challenge to hunt!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel free to join the discussion about our newest upcoming hunting reserve here: &lt;a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/0/1473096694452504809/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" &gt;http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/0/1473096694452504809/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which of these animals are you most excited to find on your first visit to Medved-Taiga?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/Graham&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>New Reserve Revealed!  First Look at Medved-Taiga.</title>
      <description>Hello Hunters!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big thanks to those of you who took part in our guessing games last week, now it's time for your efforts to pay off!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As many of you correctly guessed, we are taking you to cooler climes with our next big content release. Our next DLC (optional, paid content) will be a whole new reserve for you to explore, the Medved-Taiga National Park! Inspired by the frozen landscape of Siberia, Medved-Taiga gives hunters an entirely new experience to enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with our previous paid DLC, it's possible for players that don't own the reserve themselves to experience it by joining a multiplayer game set-up by a host that owns the content&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expect lots of information to follow in the coming days and weeks, we have lots to talk about (and show). For now though, we can elaborate on last week's first clue, it was indeed lynx fur! The lynx will be just one of the several different species you can expect to find in this new reserve, more info on the full line-up coming soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, without further ado, how about some screenshots? No, they aren't photos, these were all snapped in-game! ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join the discussion here: &lt;a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/0/1473096694452504809/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" &gt;http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/0/1473096694452504809/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/a8786e6c450310ccb9caff3a1a21050aca1c8658.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/5d97afb3d54faffbded3e45037607204ddfb4514.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/e54a36fd7fd8b37202f50dc7884c5a54e11f49a2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/4ac5dd03ab9dfec2c4a8765fb385a1160c3c7745.jpg"&gt;</description>

The goal is to harvest a combined amount of 6.500 Roe Deer until tomorrow 17:00CEST.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those of you following our streaming format 'The Hunting Lodge' may already know that the Roe Deer is indeed the animal that has been the cause of the most in-game deaths for hunters in Call of the Wild since launch. Be careful out there and watch your back at all times! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best of luck to all of you :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;theHunter: Call of the Wild Team</description>

      <title>THEHUNTER: COTW - Patch 1.11.1</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27000850/ffc87cae21edd95b5d08f17d7e05fc3e794885aa.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hello Hunters,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patch 1.11.1 is here and brings a number of new fixes to the game - we hope you’ll enjoy them! We have addressed one of the biggest issues concerning animal behavior and reactions not working as intended, sometimes making them move in a circle rather than fleeing or following a logical path. We also continued to work with a lot of your feedback to further improve the issue of disappearing tents. Please have a look at the list below for a detailed overview of all improvements introduced by this patch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix for a crash when entering the southwest corner of Hirschfelden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix for possible crash when a player leaves a multiplayer game while seated on an ATV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix for network de-sync when players leave a multiplayer game, causing animals to stop reacting to players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix for animals sometimes running in circles or not reacting to players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional improvements for disappearing tents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix for unlocalized item descriptions for bows in the store screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix for rain sounds stuttering near certain areas in the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix for a message about driving an ATV into the water showing for all players in a multiplayer game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Let us know what you think about this hotfix in the &lt;a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/0/1473095965287785867/?tscn=1504722947/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" &gt;Patch 1.11 feedback thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy Hunting,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;theHunter: Call of the Wild Team&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: The reason why the patch is 1.8GB is that we have re-modeled some parts of the landscape to fix related crashes. These changes are very heavy in file size.</description>

You can find these two options in the Game settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inventory system has been reworked with the aim to make it a lot more intuitive to use for both keyboards as well as game pads. Item highlighting, for example, will make it easier and much faster to get an overview of which equipment and ammunition are compatible with your carried weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’ve added additional fixes to disappearing tents and ground blinds, while also adding a check so that every player always has at least 5 tents and 5 ground blinds (counting across storage, inventory and placed in the world) owned at any time. We will monitor how this works - please let us know what you think in the feedback thread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of the above mentioned, this patch introduces many more fixes such as temporal antialiasing (find it in the Graphics settings), balancing of missions, fixes for bleeding rates and animal behaviour, a new death sequence when the player dies, new animations for bears, automated codex entries when interacting with point of interests, and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As always you can find the full list of changes below and we are looking forward to your feedback in the &lt;a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/0/1473095965287785867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" &gt;dedicated forum thread for Patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy Hunting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;theHunter: Call of the Wild Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;Features&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manual Reload&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enabling the ‘Manual Reload’ option in the Game settings allows you to manually reload your weapons. Once your magazine clip is empty, it won’t be reloaded automatically if the option is enabled. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manual Chambering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enabling the ‘Manual Chambering’ option in the Game settings allows you to manually chamber the next shot. After taking a shot, you then easily chamber the next bullet by pressing the reload button.This will allow you to better track your shots and the hit reactions of animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Temporal Anti-Aliasing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;Missions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Family Picture: changed objective from taking a photo of 2 bears in one photo to a two photos of 2 different bears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jäger #4: changed deer rank requirement from GOLD to SILVER and added a distance requirement&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jäger #7: changed deer rank condition from GOLD to SILVER&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sommer #2: removed the high scoring animal requirement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sommer #7: changed the amount of GOLD score roe deer harvests needed from 4 to 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beatty #4: changed trophy rating from GOLD to SILVER and tweaked photography parameters to make it easier to take a suitable photo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;Gameplay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Animal bleed rates were adjusted &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Animals no longer get stuck when luring them to an outpost&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Animals no longer leave trails of need zones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved fleeing behaviour of animals with less running in circles (this will be tweaked further in the future)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added player death sequence and ragdoll&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updated hit reaction and injured animations for bears&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed display bug with “Ranger” perk regarding distances&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;Tents and Ground Blinds&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added check for players to always have at least 5 Tents and 5 Ground Blinds (combined between your storage, inventory and in the world)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;User Interface&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Inventory System&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved rendering of in-game player names&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Codex is now opened automatically when interacting with landmarks and cairns - this also works retroactively&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added player death notifications in the chat log&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Player name colors now match player icons on the map&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrolling with the mouse wheel while the map is hidden no longer affects the zoom level of the map&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New message displaying when player have been kicked from a multiplayer game&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added contextual help for ATV when entering for the first time&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added setting to display/hide the HUD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiplayer harvest messages in the chat will now display the accumulated harvest score for the animal harvested instead of the base animal score.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed issue where the player’s heart rate would get inappropriately updated while on an ATV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;Audio&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ATVs now create sounds when passing through vegetation like bushes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exchanged the voice over line for “There is a track nearby”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added Anti-Aliasing graphical setting&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed hand textures on female variation #5&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terrain tessellation now correctly matches physics settings after changing map&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Travel-related achievements will now work correctly for new players&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed one issues that could cause the game to freeze&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="bb_h1"&gt;Tobii&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="bb_ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixes for crashes related to Extended View&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
